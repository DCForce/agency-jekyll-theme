            <p>Sobremesa Farm was founded in 2013 with the idea of providing organically grown farm fresh fruit and vegetables directly to the local community. They have a Facebook page and Instagram page like other farms. But they want a professional website to increase visibility and do online business.<br>They meet us because one of our team member Mengyi visited and interviewed them for a school project last year.</p>

            <p>Our main goal is to use the website to publicize the farm. By creating a project scope based on that, we clearly set expectations for our clients. Besides, we reported to them weekly so they would know how things were moving along.</p>

        <h1 class="service-heading">Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>During the field research, personally experience the farm and interview some users, we believe that Sobremesa Farm needs a website that will <strong>more accurately portray the exceptional quality of produces</strong> that is offered at its farm, and drive an <strong>increase in market attention and satisfied customers.</strong></p>

        <h1 class="service-heading">Design Concept</h1>
            <p>In addition to adding new content, we also implemented two features based on our research to support their needs in their farming business:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>Online payments</h5>
                    <p>Instead of coming and purchasing at the farm, customers have an easier way to pay. I did researches on Wordpress, which is the platform they are comfortable with, and implement a Square payment plug-in named WP Easy Pay.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Email newsletter subscription</h5>
                    <p>Originally they asked visitors to leave their email on papers and emailed them manually to disseminate events information. So I did researches and imported an email marketing service tool Mailchimp to the website.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
