              <p>In the case of the <b>Cambridge Analytica scandal</b>, user data was acquired from Facebook to create more targeted political advertising, with the promise of swaying a major election. Governments can also gain access to this data. This case reminds us that we must be aware that our data can be used in ways that we don’t knowingly consent to.

    <p>Our concept is a VR art installation that will demonstrate to a user firsthand their data being sold, and show them how painful it can be to have their agency about this process removed. At the start they will be totally immersed in new technologies that entice them to interact with their world in fun ways. At the end it will be revealed that the data they’ve input into these applications is being sold without their consent.<br>Through the VR experience, we wanted to force users to confront their lack of agency in this situation by physically putting the user in the middle of such a transaction.</p></div>
