              <h3>Background</h3>
              In the case of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, user data was acquired from Facebook to create more targeted political advertising, with the promise of swaying a major election. Governments can also gain access to this data. This case reminds us that we must be aware that our data can be used in ways that we don’t knowingly consent to. 
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
              <h3>Interests</h3>
              Before we sign up for a new service or buy a new piece of technology, we must ask ourselves:
              <ul>
                <li>What kind of data is being collected from me?</li>
                <li>Am I comfortable with this data being sold and used in ways I may never know about?</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
      </div>
  <div class="row text-left" style="background-color: black;">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div style="padding-top: 56.25%; position: relative; overflow: hidden;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" style="position: absolute; height: 100%; width: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;" src="https://onelineplayer.com/player.html?autoplay=false&loop=false&autopause=false&muted=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1vSejrGjO1U&poster=&time=true&progressBar=true&playButton=true&overlay=true&muteButton=true&fullscreenButton=true&style=light&logo=true&quality=720p" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

    <h3>Design Concept</h3>
    <p>Our concept is a VR art installation that will demonstrate to a user firsthand their data being sold, and show them how painful it can be to have their agency about this process removed. At the start they will be totally immersed in new technologies that entice them to interact with their world in fun ways. At the end it will be revealed that the data they’ve input into these applications is being sold without their consent.</p>
