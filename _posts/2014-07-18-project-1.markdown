### Researches
    We should be wary about the other ways this data might be utilized. Everyday, the data we create gets stored by the applications, devices, and websites we use [1, 2]. Mostly, this information is used to convince users to buy things: “Websites need data to make their products better and to sell you the advertisements that keep them afloat,” says David Nield of Gizmodo [2]. 

    Paul Stephens, a director at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, says “It’s hard to tell who’s selling what to whom” [3]. This fact could be disturbing to some people. The fact that many people either (1) don’t know what data is being collected from them when they use a new app/website and (2) don’t know for what purposes this data is being sold becomes an issues of consent. We know that there are companies such as Acxiom that traffic in our data, and that they have “on average, 1,500 pieces of information on more than 200 million Americans” [4].
